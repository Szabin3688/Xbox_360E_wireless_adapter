# Xbox_360E_wireless_adapter
This project was made to convert a 360E wireless module from the console to a pc to use the controllers


## Getting Started

First you'll nedd to order a pcb with the included pcb files, and solder it to the pcb.


### Install
After you soldered the boards together, plug it in to the pc. Open the Device Manager and you should see an unrecognized device. Right click on it and go to prperties. Go to Drivers. Click on "Update drivers". Then search on computer, then choose from the list. And try to find the Xbox 360 accessories. Click on it and select the xbox 360 wireless receiver. The device should work.

## Other info
- I didn't test it on macos, only windows
- Windows sometimes forgets what device it is, select the driver manually again
- The receiver ONLY accepts 3.3v on the power line!
- You should pair the controllers to the reciever, when it's in the console, when it's in the pc it only connects to the already paired controllers.

## Working on
- Integrated 3.3v converter from the USB's 5v

## Already tested wireless reciever boards
- Xbox 360 E WIRELESS MODEL 1575
